# Archived Database Tests - Future Premium Feature Reference

## 📋 Overview
These test concepts were created for the original database-first architecture. They are archived here for reference when implementing Supabase as a premium cloud sync feature.

## 🎯 Future Premium Architecture
When implementing Supabase premium features, the architecture will be:
- **Local-first**: Core functionality works offline with AsyncStorage
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: Premium users get multi-device sync via Supabase
- **Hybrid Data Flow**: Local data syncs to cloud, not cloud-first

## 🧪 Test Concepts to Recreate

### 1. Schema Validation Tests
**Original Focus**: Direct database schema validation
**Future Focus**: Local-to-cloud data mapping and sync integrity

**Key Test Areas for Premium:**
- Local data structure matches cloud schema
- Data transformation during sync (local IDs → cloud IDs)
- Schema migration handling for existing local users

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Tests  
**Original Focus**: Database-level security policies
**Future Focus**: API-level security for premium sync endpoints

**Key Test Areas for Premium:**
- User can only sync their own data
- Multi-device access control for shared homes
- Premium subscription validation before cloud access

### 3. Data Integrity Tests
**Original Focus**: Foreign key constraints in database
**Future Focus**: Sync conflict resolution and data consistency

**Key Test Areas for Premium:**
- Conflict resolution when same data modified on multiple devices
- Orphaned record handling during partial syncs
- Data recovery from cloud backup

## 🔄 Sync-Specific Tests Needed

### Multi-Device Sync Tests
```typescript
// Example future test structure
describe('Premium Cloud Sync', () => {
  test('should sync local changes to cloud')
  test('should pull cloud changes to local')
  test('should resolve conflicts with last-write-wins')
  test('should handle offline-to-online transitions')
  test('should backup complete local dataset')
})
```

### Premium Feature Tests
```typescript
describe('Premium Features', () => {
  test('should enable cloud sync for premium users')
  test('should disable sync when subscription expires')
  test('should allow home sharing between premium users')
  test('should provide cloud-powered analytics')
})
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

When implementing premium Supabase features:

1. **Start with local-first tests** (already complete ✅)
2. **Add sync integration tests** for premium workflows
3. **Test offline-first behavior** with optional cloud enhancement
4. **Validate premium subscription gates** for cloud features
5. **Test data migration** from local-only to hybrid users

## 🗃️ Original Test Files (Archived)
- `database/schema.test.ts` - Database schema validation
- `database/rls.test.ts` - Row level security policies  
- `models/equipment.test.ts` - Equipment database operations
- `models/tasks.test.ts` - Task database operations
- `connection.test.ts` - Database connection testing

These files contained valuable test patterns but assumed database-first architecture incompatible with the current local-first approach.

## 🎯 Strategic Value
This archive preserves the testing concepts while acknowledging that the premium implementation will require a fundamentally different testing approach focused on hybrid local-cloud architecture rather than database-first operations.
