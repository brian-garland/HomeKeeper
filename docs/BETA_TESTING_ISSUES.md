### Issue #002 - App doesn't adjust for larger font sizes (accessibility)
- **Reporter:** Rollin
- **Date Reported:** 2025-06-25
- **Date Resolved:** 2025-01-26
- **Device/Platform:** [To be specified]
- **App Version:** [To be specified]
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Category:** UI/UX

**Description:**
The app does not properly adjust its layout when the user has set larger font sizes in their device settings. This causes text and UI elements to be cut off or not visible, preventing users from completing basic actions.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Set device font size to a larger setting (Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Larger Text)
2. Open the HomeKeeper app
3. Navigate to the onboarding flow
4. Observe that CTAs like "Get Started" on Step 1 are not visible/accessible

**Expected Behavior:**
The app should dynamically adjust its layout to accommodate larger font sizes, ensuring all text and interactive elements remain visible and accessible.

**Actual Behavior:**
CTAs and other UI elements are cut off or hidden when larger font sizes are used, making the app unusable for users who need accessibility features.

**Screenshots/Videos:**
[If applicable - would be very helpful to show the cut-off elements]

**Additional Notes:**
This is an accessibility issue that could prevent users with visual impairments from using the app. Should be prioritized as it affects app usability for users who rely on larger text sizes.

**Resolution Notes:**
âœ… **Fixed** - Implemented comprehensive responsive typography system:
- Added PixelRatio.getFontScale() support with 85%-200% scaling bounds
- Updated typography.ts with getResponsiveFontSize() utilities  
- Enhanced PrimaryButton with accessibility-aware dynamic sizing
- Fixed onboarding layout overlaps by removing space-between layouts
- Added ScrollView structure to prevent content cut-off
- Tested successfully with iOS large font settings
- All text now scales properly while maintaining usable layouts

### Issue #003 - Add Task workflow automatically associates all tasks with 'Roof' equipment
- **Reporter:** Brian
- **Date Reported:** 2025-01-25
- **Device/Platform:** [To be specified]
- **App Version:** [To be specified]
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Category:** Functionality

**Description:**
When creating a new task through the Add Task workflow, the system automatically associates every task with the 'Roof' equipment item, regardless of user selection or the actual nature of the task.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to Add Task screen
2. Fill out task information
3. Complete the task creation workflow
4. Observe that the task is automatically associated with 'Roof' equipment

**Expected Behavior:**
Users should be able to select the appropriate equipment item for their task, or leave it unassociated with any equipment if not applicable. The system should not default to any specific equipment.

**Actual Behavior:**
All tasks are automatically associated with 'Roof' equipment regardless of user input or task type.

**Screenshots/Videos:**
[If applicable]

**Additional Notes:**
This affects the accuracy of task organization and could lead to confusion when users try to view tasks by equipment. Could impact task filtering and equipment-specific maintenance tracking.

**Resolution Notes:**
