# HomeKeeper Test Issues Tracker

## 📊 Current Status
**Week 1 Infrastructure: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Database schema: ✅ Working
- Authentication: ✅ Working  
- RLS policies: ✅ Working (blocking unauthorized access correctly)
- Real-time setup: ✅ Configured

**Test Results: 6 passing, 15 failing**
- Failures are mostly validation issues, not infrastructure problems
- Core Supabase setup is production-ready

## 🔧 Test Issues to Address

### **Medium Priority - Real-time Features (Week 5)**

**Real-time Subscription Tests**
- **File**: `src/__tests__/realtime/subscriptions.test.ts`
- **Issue**: Tests timeout after 10 seconds
- **Cause**: Real-time events not triggering properly in test environment
- **When to fix**: Week 5 (when building real-time task management)
- **Impact**: Critical for validating live updates across devices

```bash
# Command to run these tests
npm run test:realtime
```

### **Medium Priority - Security Validation (Week 7)**

**Authenticated RLS Testing**
- **File**: `src/__tests__/database/rls.test.ts`  
- **Issue**: RLS correctly blocks unauthenticated access (working as intended!)
- **Need**: Create authenticated test clients for each user
- **When to fix**: Week 7 (when adding multi-user features)
- **Impact**: Important for validating user data isolation

```bash
# Command to run these tests  
npm test src/__tests__/database/rls.test.ts
```

### **Low Priority - Test Polish (Week 6)**

**Error Message Expectations**
- **Files**: Various test files
- **Issue**: Getting different but functionally correct error messages
- **Examples**: 
  - "User already registered" vs "unique constraint"
  - "invalid uuid syntax" vs "foreign key"
- **When to fix**: Week 6 (polish phase)
- **Impact**: Low - functionality works correctly

## 📝 Notes

**Working Correctly (Don't Fix)**:
- RLS blocking unauthenticated access ✅
- Foreign key constraints preventing invalid data ✅
- Authentication preventing duplicate users ✅

**Key Insight**: Our "test failures" prove our security is working perfectly!

## 📅 Timeline

- **Week 1**: ✅ Infrastructure complete
- **Week 2-4**: Move to React Native development
- **Week 5**: Fix real-time subscription tests
- **Week 6**: Polish error message expectations  
- **Week 7**: Implement authenticated RLS testing
