## 🧪 Testing Methodology & Philosophy

**Testing Approach:** Proactive, continuous testing integrated into development workflow  
**Test Coverage Target:** 90%+ for business-critical code  
**Testing Framework:** Jest + React Native Testing Library + Custom Supabase Test Utils  

### Testing Phases by Development Stage:

#### Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-6):
- **Week 1**: Infrastructure validation (database, auth, real-time)
- **Weeks 2-3**: Test-driven development for data models and React Native components
- **Week 6**: Comprehensive foundation testing and performance benchmarking

#### Intelligence Phase (Weeks 7-12):
- **Algorithm Accuracy Testing**: AI/ML features tested with 95%+ accuracy requirements
- **Privacy Compliance Testing**: GDPR/CCPA compliance verification for all learning systems
- **Integration Testing**: All intelligence features working seamlessly together

#### Community Phase (Weeks 13-18):
- **Privacy-First Testing**: Community features must pass privacy protection tests
- **Scalability Testing**: Multi-user, neighborhood-level performance validation
- **Social Feature Testing**: User interaction flows and community value validation

#### Optimization Phase (Weeks 19-24):
- **Performance Testing**: <2s launch time, 60fps performance, minimal battery usage  
- **Load Testing**: 1000+ users, large datasets, concurrent operations
- **Production Readiness**: Security, accessibility, app store compliance

### Daily Testing Commands:
```bash
# Foundation check (run at start of each week)
npm test

# Specific test suites
npm run test:database      # Database operations
npm run test:realtime      # Real-time subscriptions  
npm run test:auth          # Authentication flows
npm run test:intelligence  # AI/ML features
npm run test:community     # Community features

# Coverage and performance
npm run test:coverage      # Test coverage report
npm run test:performance   # Performance benchmarks
```

### Test Issue Management:
- **Immediate Fix**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, crashes
- **This Week**: Functionality blocking current development  
- **Next Phase**: Quality improvements and polish items
- **Documentation**: All test issues tracked with priorities and timelines

**Key Insight:** Many "test failures" actually prove security is working correctly (RLS blocking unauthorized access). Test results must be interpreted contextually, not just by pass/fail counts.
