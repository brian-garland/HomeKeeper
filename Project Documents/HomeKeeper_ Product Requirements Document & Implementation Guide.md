## Executive Summary: Think Different About Home Maintenance

The home maintenance industry is broken. Homeowners are drowning in complexity, overwhelmed by feature-bloated applications that promise everything and deliver confusion. We're going to fix this.

HomeKeeper isn't just another home maintenance app. It's a complete reimagining of how people should interact with their most valuable asset. While our competitors pile on features like digital hoarders, we're going to do what Apple has always done: subtract until only the essential remains, then make that essential absolutely magical.

Our research shows that 61% of millennials feel burnt out by home maintenance, and 60% of all homeowners are deferring necessary tasks. The current solutions—HomeZada with its overwhelming complexity, Dwellin with its bugs, Oply with its expensive vendor lock-in—all miss the fundamental point: people don't want to manage their home maintenance. They want their home maintenance to manage itself.

HomeKeeper will be the iPhone of home maintenance apps. Not because it has more features, but because it makes the complex simple, the overwhelming manageable, and the necessary delightful. And with Supabase + Model Context Protocol integration, we'll build it faster, better, and more intelligently than ever before possible.

## Part I: The Vision - Redefining Home Maintenance

### The Problem We're Solving

Every homeowner faces the same fundamental challenge: their home is simultaneously their largest investment and their most complex responsibility. Unlike any other major purchase, homes require continuous, proactive care across dozens of systems and hundreds of components. The consequences of neglect are severe—our research shows an average of $5,650 in deferred maintenance costs per household, with 41% of homeowners paying for major repairs that could have been prevented.

But the real problem isn't that homeowners don't understand the importance of maintenance. The problem is that the current solutions make maintenance feel like a part-time job. HomeZada requires users to become amateur accountants, tracking every expense and managing complex financial integrations. Dwellin promises AI-powered simplicity but delivers buggy interfaces and overwhelming feature sets. Oply focuses on vendor relationships rather than empowering homeowners to take control of their own properties.

These solutions fundamentally misunderstand what homeowners actually want. They don't want to become maintenance experts. They don't want to manage vendor relationships. They don't want to track every dollar spent on their home. They want one simple thing: to know what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and how to do it right.

### Our Differentiation Strategy: The Three Pillars

#### Pillar 1: Radical Simplicity
While competitors add features, we subtract complexity. HomeKeeper will have exactly three core functions: Know (what needs to be done), When (it needs to be done), and How (to do it right). Every feature request, every design decision, every line of code will be evaluated against these three pillars. If it doesn't directly serve one of these functions, it doesn't belong in HomeKeeper.

This isn't just about having fewer features. It's about creating an experience so intuitive that homeowners never need to think about the app itself—only about caring for their homes. The interface will be so clean, so obvious, so perfectly crafted that using it feels like a natural extension of homeownership rather than an additional burden.

#### Pillar 2: Proactive Intelligence
Current solutions are reactive. They wait for users to input information, set up complex profiles, and manually manage their maintenance schedules. HomeKeeper will be proactive. Using intelligent defaults based on home age, location, and type, the app will immediately provide value without requiring extensive setup.

But this intelligence won't be the black-box AI that competitors promise and fail to deliver. It will be transparent, explainable intelligence that helps users understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Every recommendation will come with clear explanations of consequences, benefits, and alternatives.

#### Pillar 3: Delightful Education
The biggest barrier to home maintenance isn't laziness—it's knowledge. Our research shows that 25% of younger homeowners are unclear about basic maintenance frequencies, and 77% don't even know that microwave grease filters exist. Instead of assuming knowledge, HomeKeeper will teach.

But we won't teach through boring manuals or overwhelming tutorials. We'll teach through beautiful, bite-sized moments of discovery that make users feel smarter and more confident about their homes. Every maintenance task will be an opportunity to learn something new, to feel more connected to their space, and to take pride in their growing expertise.

### The HomeKeeper Experience Philosophy

HomeKeeper will embody the same design philosophy that made the iPhone revolutionary: it will be immediately useful to beginners while remaining powerful enough for experts. A new homeowner will open the app and immediately see exactly what their home needs this week, this month, and this season. An experienced homeowner will find sophisticated tracking and insights that help them optimize their maintenance approach over time.

The app will feel personal without being invasive, intelligent without being opaque, and comprehensive without being overwhelming. Users will look forward to their weekly HomeKeeper check-ins the same way they look forward to checking their favorite social media app—not because maintenance is inherently exciting, but because we'll make the experience of managing maintenance genuinely delightful.

Most importantly, HomeKeeper will make users feel successful. Every completed task will be celebrated. Every prevented problem will be acknowledged. Every dollar saved through proactive maintenance will be highlighted. Users won't just maintain their homes—they'll feel proud of how well they're caring for their most important investment.

## Part II: Product Requirements Document

### Core Product Specifications

#### User Experience Architecture

The HomeKeeper experience centers on a single, beautiful home screen that immediately communicates three things: what needs attention now, what's coming up soon, and how well the user is caring for their home. This isn't a dashboard cluttered with widgets and statistics—it's a carefully crafted interface that guides attention to what matters most.

The primary interface will feature a clean, card-based design where each maintenance task is presented as a beautifully designed card containing the task name, urgency level, estimated time requirement, and a single-tap action to mark completion or get detailed guidance. The visual hierarchy will be immediately obvious: urgent tasks appear at the top with warm, attention-grabbing colors, while routine tasks use cooler, calming tones that suggest importance without urgency.

Navigation will be gesture-based and intuitive, following native platform design patterns that users already understand. Swiping left on a task card will reveal options to reschedule, get help, or mark as complete. Swiping right will show the educational content explaining why the task matters and how to do it properly. Tapping a card will open the detailed task view with step-by-step guidance, safety information, and completion tracking.

#### Intelligent Onboarding System

The onboarding experience will be HomeKeeper's first opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to simplicity and intelligence. Instead of overwhelming new users with lengthy forms and complex setup processes, the app will use a conversational approach that feels more like getting advice from a knowledgeable friend than filling out a database.

The process will begin with a single question: "What's your home's address?" Using this information, HomeKeeper will automatically determine the home's age, approximate size, local climate conditions, and typical construction characteristics. This eliminates the need for users to manually input dozens of data points while providing the foundation for intelligent maintenance recommendations.

The second step will ask users to take a simple photo tour of their home, focusing on key systems like HVAC units, water heaters, and major appliances. The app will use image recognition to identify equipment types and ages, automatically populating the maintenance schedule with manufacturer-recommended service intervals. This visual approach makes setup feel engaging rather than tedious while ensuring accuracy in maintenance recommendations.

The final onboarding step will present users with their personalized maintenance calendar, pre-populated with tasks appropriate for their specific home and current season. This immediate value demonstration ensures that users see the app's benefits before they've invested significant time in setup, creating positive first impressions that drive long-term engagement.

#### Task Management and Scheduling Engine

The core of HomeKeeper's functionality lies in its sophisticated yet invisible task management system. Unlike competitors that require users to manually create and manage maintenance schedules, HomeKeeper will automatically generate comprehensive maintenance plans based on home characteristics, local conditions, and industry best practices.

The scheduling engine will operate on multiple time horizons simultaneously. Daily tasks like checking for obvious issues or monitoring weather-related concerns will appear as gentle reminders that don't overwhelm users with urgency. Weekly tasks such as testing smoke detectors or cleaning specific appliances will be scheduled for optimal times based on user behavior patterns and preferences.

Monthly and seasonal tasks will be intelligently distributed to avoid overwhelming periods while ensuring that critical maintenance happens at optimal times. For example, HVAC filter changes will be scheduled based on local air quality conditions and usage patterns rather than arbitrary calendar dates. Gutter cleaning will be timed to occur after local leaf-fall patterns but before winter weather arrives.

The system will learn from user behavior and adjust recommendations accordingly. If a user consistently completes tasks early, the app will gradually shift schedules to match their preferences. If certain tasks are frequently delayed, the system will provide additional context about why the timing matters and offer alternative scheduling options that better fit the user's lifestyle.

#### Educational Content Integration

HomeKeeper's educational approach will be fundamentally different from the manual-style content that characterizes existing solutions. Instead of presenting information as static reference material, the app will integrate learning opportunities directly into the maintenance workflow, making education feel natural and immediately relevant.

Each maintenance task will include three levels of educational content. The basic level provides just enough information for confident task completion: what tools are needed, estimated time requirements, and key safety considerations. The intermediate level explains the why behind the task: what problems it prevents, how it saves money, and what happens if it's neglected. The advanced level offers deeper insights into home systems and optimization opportunities for users who want to develop genuine expertise.

The content will be presented through multiple media formats optimized for different learning styles and situations. Quick reference cards provide essential information for users who just need a reminder of key steps. Short video demonstrations show proper techniques for tasks that benefit from visual instruction. Interactive checklists ensure that complex multi-step processes are completed thoroughly and safely.

Seasonal educational campaigns will help users understand the broader context of home maintenance throughout the year. Spring campaigns will focus on preparing homes for increased activity and weather changes. Summer content will emphasize efficiency and outdoor maintenance. Fall campaigns will prepare homes for winter challenges, while winter content will focus on indoor air quality and system optimization.

#### Progress Tracking and Motivation System

HomeKeeper will transform maintenance tracking from a chore into a source of genuine satisfaction and pride. The progress tracking system will celebrate user achievements while providing meaningful insights into home care patterns and improvements over time.

The primary progress indicator will be the Home Health Score, a simple but sophisticated metric that reflects how well a user is caring for their property. Unlike arbitrary point systems, this score will be based on actual maintenance completion rates, task timing, and the relative importance of different maintenance activities. Users will see their score improve as they complete tasks, with bonus recognition for proactive completion and consistent patterns.

Visual progress tracking will use beautiful, intuitive graphics that make maintenance achievements feel significant. Completed tasks will be marked with satisfying animations and positive reinforcement messages. Streaks of consistent maintenance will be celebrated with special recognition and insights into the cumulative benefits of regular care.

The app will also track and highlight the financial benefits of proactive maintenance. When users complete preventive tasks, HomeKeeper will show estimates of problems prevented and money saved. These calculations will be based on industry data about repair costs and failure rates, providing concrete evidence of the value that good maintenance provides.

Long-term tracking will help users understand seasonal patterns and optimize their maintenance approach over time. Annual reports will show maintenance completion rates, seasonal trends, and areas for improvement, presented in a format that feels more like a personal achievement summary than a performance review.
