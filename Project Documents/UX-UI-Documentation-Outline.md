## üìù **Tips for Creating This Document:**

**Visual Tools You Can Use:**
- **Figma** (free, web-based, great for React Native)
- **Sketch** (Mac only, popular for mobile design)
- **Adobe XD** (cross-platform alternative)
- **Hand sketches + photos** (sometimes the fastest way to communicate)

**Don't Need to Be Perfect:**
- Focus on communicating the vision clearly
- Wireframes and rough mockups are totally fine
- Include inspiration images from apps you love
- Describe interactions even if you can't design them

**Steve Jobs Inspiration:**
- Study the original iPhone announcement for simplicity principles
- Look at early iOS design for clarity and focus
- Remember: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"
