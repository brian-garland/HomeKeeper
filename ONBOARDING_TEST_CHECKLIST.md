- [x] Geocoding converts address to coordinates
- [x] "Next" button enables after valid input
- [x] **Notes:** ~~When typing in your address the text appears to be entering into the bottom of the button versus the center. This causes some letters such as a 'y' to appear cut off at the bottom. Please see screenshot.~~ **FIXED: Text alignment corrected**

#### Step 3: Home Characteristics

- [x] Year built input accepts valid years
- [x] Square footage input works properly
- [x] All selections save properly

- [x] "Continue to App" button works
- [x] **Notes:** ~~Are the tasks within the coming up this month section just mock data? These are always the same.~~ **ANSWERED: Yes, the "Coming up this month" section in the calendar reveal step shows static preview tasks for demonstration purposes. The actual intelligent tasks are generated after onboarding completes and will be different based on your home characteristics, equipment, and current date. The preview shows: "Check HVAC Filter", "Clean Gutters", and "Test Smoke Detectors" as examples of what HomeKeeper will generate for you.**

### **3. Data Persistence & Generation**

#### Address & Geocoding
- [x] Address saves to AsyncStorage
- [x] Coordinates generated correctly (Kansas City: 39.003299, -94.59647)
- [x] Location data persists across app restarts
- [x] **Notes:** ___________

#### Equipment Generation
- [x] 9 default equipment items created
- [x] Equipment includes: HVAC, Water Heater, Smoke Detectors, CO Detectors, Roof, Gutters, Siding, Driveway, Garage Door
- [x] Equipment data saves to AsyncStorage
- [x] **Notes:** ~~The 'Clean Gutters for HVAC System' task has a weird box that says HVAC System that the other tasks do not have. Also, how is this task different from the other generated Clean Gutters task? Third item, these tasks come with a due date of tomorrow. We talked about not creating tasks immediately due. Can we adjust that logic?~~ **FIXED: All three issues resolved**

#### Task Generation
- [x] Intelligent tasks generated based on equipment and home type
- [x] Tasks have realistic due dates (not immediate)
- [x] No duplicate or conflicting tasks created
- [x] Tasks properly linked to relevant equipment
- [x] **Notes:** **FIXED ISSUES:**
  - ‚úÖ **Equipment Badge**: Removed inconsistent "HVAC System" box from task cards
  - ‚úÖ **Duplicate Tasks**: Added deduplication logic to prevent multiple similar tasks (e.g., two gutter cleaning tasks)
  - ‚úÖ **Due Date Timing**: Tasks now have minimum 1-week lead time instead of being due tomorrow
