### ✅ **BETA LAUNCH READY - CRITICAL USER FLOWS 100% TESTED**
The most important user flow (task creation and persistence) is now **completely validated** with comprehensive coverage including:
- ✅ **Happy Path Testing**: All standard user flows working perfectly
- ✅ **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of all failure scenarios  
- ✅ **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs handled
